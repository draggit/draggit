# draggit
An alternative frontend for git that offers instant usability for non-technical users.

Draggit offers a drag and drop interface of files and folders. You just drag a file to your desktop, make modifications, and then drag it back - and just like that, you've made a commit to a git repository.

No command line, no installation. 100% free. All you need is a Github account and a browser.
